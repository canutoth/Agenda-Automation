# theGayAgenda

not ready yet bc college's been killing me, but the general idea is some kind of "alexa" that schedules stuff for me on a faster/more efficient way

using google calendar API rn for most of it, but ideally in the future i'll get around with something better that processes NL instead of having any sort of specific format for the prompts bc that kinda takes the whole "faster" idea away lol >.<
